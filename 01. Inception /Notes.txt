What is a CDN?

CDN stands for content delivery network which is basically used for storing the static data of an application
to the nearby Cache's of a user and then deliver the data to him faster and as per his location whenever the user tries to
access the static data from that application's main server.

It minimizes the latency and is effective in delivering location based data to the users.
