What is a CDN?

CDN stands for content delivery network which is basically used for storing the static data of an application
to the nearby Cache of a user and then deliver the data to him faster and as per his location whenever the user tries to
access the static data from that application's main server.

It minimizes the latency and is effective in delivering location-based data to the users.

In our case, CDN is a place where our React library is hosted and we are fetching that React, putting it into our code 
and using it using CDN links.

Using the CDN link is a way of using React in our project.
